# OctoAcme Project Management Guide

Welcome to OctoAcme! This guide provides an overview of how we run projects, our key processes, and the roles involved. Whether you're a new team member or need a quick refresher, this document will help you understand our approach to delivering customer value through iterative, well-coordinated teamwork.

## Our Approach and Key Workflows

OctoAcme follows a structured project lifecycle that emphasizes customer-first thinking, iterative delivery, and clear ownership. Every project moves through five phases: [**Initiation**](octoacme-project-initiation.md) (validating the problem and creating a project one-pager), [**Planning**](octoacme-project-planning.md) (breaking work into actionable increments with clear acceptance criteria), [**Execution**](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) (daily standups, weekly syncs, and continuous progress tracking via project boards), [**Release**](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md) (deploying with proper smoke tests and rollback plans), and [**Retrospective**](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md) (capturing learnings and actionable improvements). Our execution model uses GitHub Projects with standard workflow columns (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and emphasizes small pull requests, automated testing, and at least one approval before merging. Quality assurance is embedded throughout: unit and integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI, and manual QA for feature acceptance. We measure success through velocity, burndown charts, and the success metrics defined in each project's one-pager.

## Roles, Personas, and Team Rhythms

Our cross-functional teams include clearly defined [**roles**](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md): **Project Managers (PM)** coordinate delivery, manage schedules and risks, and maintain project documentation; **Product Managers (PdM)** define what to build, prioritize the backlog, and measure outcomes; **Developers** implement features, write tests, and participate in code reviews; **QA/Testing** validates quality and acceptance criteria; and **Stakeholders** provide inputs and approvals. Communication follows predictable cadences: daily standups (15 minutes, focusing on progress and blockers), twice-weekly delivery team syncs, weekly PM + PdM alignment meetings, monthly stakeholder updates, and demo/review sessions at the end of each sprint or milestone. Each project maintains a single source of truth in its project README or release doc, and weekly status updates follow a standard template covering progress, next steps, risks/blockers, and decisions needed.

## Communication and Stakeholder Engagement

Effective [**communication and risk management**](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) are critical to our success. We identify stakeholder groups early (engineering, sales, support, etc.) and tailor communication to their needs, providing regular updates at weekly or milestone-based intervals. Our risk management approach involves maintaining a risk register that tracks ID, description, impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation plan, and status. Risks are identified during planning and ongoing execution, assessed for impact and likelihood, mitigated through actions and contingency plans, and monitored at weekly syncs. Escalation paths are clear: team-level triage occurs in daily standups, the PM escalates to the Product Lead and dependent teams as needed, and sponsor-level escalation handles business-impacting issues. For incidents, we follow a structured communication approach including triage summary, actions being taken, expected timeline, and scheduling a blameless post-incident retrospective.

## Getting Started and Continuous Improvement

We believe in psychological safety, data-informed decisions, and continuous improvement—after each sprint, release, or milestone, we run retrospectives to capture what went well, what could be improved, and 2-3 top action items with clear owners and timelines. These improvements are tracked in our backlog and reviewed in weekly PM syncs, creating a culture of measurable, iterative enhancement.
