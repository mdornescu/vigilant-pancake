# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

### Cross-Functional Planning Considerations

To ensure effective collaboration across all roles, incorporate these activities into your planning phase:

#### User Research & UX Design
- Schedule user research activities with UX Designer (customer interviews, surveys, usability studies)
- Allocate time for UX design iterations (wireframes, mockups, prototypes)
- Plan design review sessions with Product Manager and key stakeholders
- Schedule design handoff sessions with Developers
- Include time for design implementation validation and UX QA

#### Requirements Gathering & Analysis
- Conduct Business Analyst-led requirements workshops with stakeholders
- Document business processes and create process flow diagrams
- Define business rules, validation logic, and edge cases
- Plan for user acceptance testing (UAT) with business stakeholders
- Identify data migration or integration requirements

#### DevOps & Infrastructure Planning
- Assess infrastructure needs with DevOps Engineer (compute, storage, networking)
- Plan CI/CD pipeline enhancements or new automation
- Schedule infrastructure provisioning and environment setup
- Identify monitoring, logging, and alerting requirements
- Plan capacity testing and performance benchmarking
- Budget for infrastructure costs and optimizations

#### Testing & Quality Assurance
- Develop comprehensive test strategy with QA Engineer
- Define test environments and test data requirements
- Plan test automation efforts and tool setup
- Schedule dedicated QA time for each feature milestone
- Allocate time for regression testing and performance testing

#### Support Readiness & Customer Success
- Plan support documentation creation with Customer Support Lead
- Schedule support team training sessions before release
- Identify customer communication needs and timing
- Prepare FAQs and troubleshooting guides
- Define support escalation procedures for new features

#### Integration Checkpoints
- Schedule regular cross-functional sync meetings (bi-weekly recommended)
- Define handoff gates between roles (see [Cross-Functional Checklist](octoacme-cross-functional-checklist.md))
- Ensure each role has visibility into dependencies and timelines
- Plan demos or showcases at key milestones for stakeholder alignment


## Backlog Item Template

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
